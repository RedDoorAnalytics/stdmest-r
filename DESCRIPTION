Title: Post-Estimation Predictions for Standardised Hierarchical Contrasts after -mestreg- Models in Stata
Version: 0.0.1-9000

  person(given = "Alessandro",
         family = "Gasparini",

Description: Compute predictions of, e.g., standardised survival probabilities while fixing posterior
  predictions of the random effects at any level of the hierarchy after fitting -mestreg- models.
  Marginal predictions standardising across observed covariates (i.e., the fixed effects), while fixing
  predicted values of the random effects, can be obtained.
