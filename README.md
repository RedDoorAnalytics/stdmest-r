This is a prototype package to implement regression standardisation for
(fair) comparison between hierarchical units in multilevel survival
models. It is the R equivalent of
[`stdmest`](https://github.com/RedDoorAnalytics/stdmest) in Stata,
useful for reasoning about implementation details and for comparison
purposes.
